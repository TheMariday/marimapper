### Marimapper uses your webcam to map addressable LEDs to 3D space!

![](docs/images/reconstruct_with_normals_and_strips.png)

Above example data folder can be found under [docs/highbeam_example/](docs/highbeam_example)

## Step 0: Install

```shell
pip --version # Ensure that it is //not// python 3.12, see above
pip install pipx
pipx ensurepath
pipx install "git+https://github.com/themariday/marimapper"
```

If you have Python 3.12 installed, install 3.11 and add `--python /path/to/python3.11` to the above `pipx install` command 

pipx not working? You can also download this repo and run `pip install .` from inside it

You can run the scripts anywhere by just typing them into a console, on windows append `.exe` to the script name.

You can append `--help` to any command to show you all argument options.

## Step 1: Test your camera

Run `marimapper_check_camera` to ensure your camera is compatible with MariMapper, or check the list below:

<details>

<summary>Working Cameras</summary>

- HP 4310 (settings may not revert)
- Logitech C920
- Dell Latitude 5521 built-in
- HP Envy x360 built-in 
- If your camera works, please drop me a line, so I can add it to the list!

</details>


Test LED identification by turning down the lights and holding a torch or led up to the camera.

This should start with few warnings, no errors and produce a **very** dark image
with a single crosshair on centered on your LED.


![alt text](docs/images/camera_check.png "Camera Check window")


> [!TIP]
> If your camera doesn't support exposure adjustment, or the image is still too bright, try dimming the lights and playing around with the `--exposure` and `--threshold` arguments

## Step 2: Choose your backend

For the Marimapper to communicate with your leds, it requires a backend.

The following backends are built-in:

<details>
<summary>Fadecandy</summary>

To use the Fadecandy backend, please ensure that you are running the Fadecandy server
A fork of the Fadecandy repo can be found [here](https://github.com/TheMariday/fadecandy)

</details>

<details>
<summary>WLED</summary>

More info can be found [here](https://kno.wled.ge/)

</details>

<details>
<summary>FCMega</summary>

This is a custom driver I've written for the Teensy 4.1 to drive up to 9600 leds.
Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/TheMariday/fcmega)

</details>

<details>
<summary>PixelBlaze</summary>

Using Pixelblaze as a backend requires you to upload the 
[marimapper.epe](marimapper/backends/pixelblaze/marimapper.epe) 
pattern to your pixelblaze using 
`marimapper_upload_to_pixelblaze` 
before running Marimapper.

</details>

If your LED backend isn't supported, you need to write your own.
Open a new python file called `my_backend.py` and copy the below stub into it.

```python
class Backend:

    def __init__(self):
        # connect to some device here!

    def get_led_count(self) -> int:
        # return the number of leds your system can control here

    def set_led(self, led_index: int, on: bool) -> None:
        # Write your code for controlling your LEDs here
        # It should turn on or off the LED at the led_index depending on the "on" variable
        # For example:
        # if on:
        #     some_led_library.set_led(led_index, (255, 255, 255))
        # else:
        #     some_led_library.set_led(led_index, (0, 0, 0))
```

If your backend needs any external libraries for example, `requests`, add them to marimapper with `pipx inject marimapper requests` 

Fill out the blanks and check it by running `marimapper_check_backend --backend my_backend.py`


## Step 3: [It's time to thunderize!](https://youtu.be/-5KJiHc3Nuc?t=121)

In a new folder, run `marimapper --backend fadecandy`

and `fadecandy` to whatever backend you're using and use `--help` to show more options

Set up your LEDs so most of them are in view and when you're ready, type `y` when prompted with `Start scan? [y/n]`

This will turn each LED on and off in turn, do not move the camera or leds during capture!

If you just want a 2D map, this is where you can stop!

Rotate your leds or move your webcam to a new position

> [!TIP]
> As long as some of your leds are mostly in view, you can move your webcam to wherever you like!
> Try and get at least 3 views between 6° - 20° apart

Once you have at least 2 2d maps, a new window will appear showing the reconstructed 3D positions of your LEDs.

If it doesn't look quite right, add some more scans!

Here is an example reconstruction of a test tube of LEDs I have

![](docs/images/live_example.png)

<details>
<summary>How to move the model around</summary>

- Click and drag to rotate the model around. 
- Hold shift to roll the camera
- Use the scroll wheel to zoom in / out
- Use the `n` key to hide / show normals
- Use the `+` / `-` keys to increase / decrease point sizes
- Use `1`, `2` & `3` keys to change colour scheme
