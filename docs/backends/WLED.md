# WLED Backend Tutorial

WLED should work pretty much out of the box, test your backend with `marimapper_check_backend --backend wled`. It should cause LED 0 to blink.

If you need to change the server address, use the `--server` argument

Once you've checked your WLED setup is talking nicely with marimapper, you can go ahead and start mapping!

Few, that was a short tutorial. Treat yourself to a biscuit for all your hard work!
