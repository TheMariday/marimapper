# FC Mega Backend Tutorial

Why are you here? You don't have an FC Mega, shoo.

In all seriousness, the FC mega is an LED driver of my own creation for one of my upcoming projects.

This was born out of a fondness of the FadeCandy boards back in the day. I loved their plug and play approach.

So I've developed a new one, more powerful and more buggy than ever before!

The key thing is the Teensy that drove the FadeCandy board has been upgraded from a Teensy 2.0 to a 4.1 which means I can control OVER 10'000 LEDS OVER USB MUHAHAHAHAHA!

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/TheMariday/fcmega) if you are absolutely insane like me.

And again, why are you here? Please don't tell me you're gonna make one of these and use it...

Oh no.
