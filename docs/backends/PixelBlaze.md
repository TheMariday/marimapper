Using Pixelblaze as a backend requires you to upload the 
[marimapper.epe](https://github.com/TheMariday/marimapper/blob/main/marimapper/backends/pixelblaze/marimapper.epe) 
into the PixelBlaze editor and upload it as a new pattern otherwise the backend will fail

By default `--backend pixelblaze` will use the server address `4.3.2.1`

If you want to change the server address to `1.2.3.4`, add `--server 1.2.3.4`

Once you've completed your 3D map, upload it to pixelblaze using
`marimapper_upload_to_pixelblaze --help`
